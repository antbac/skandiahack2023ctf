2. Run `git clone https://github.com/antbac/skandiahack2023ctf.git --depth 1`
3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd skandiahack2023ctf`

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Gitpod 

1. Login to [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) and use <https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/antbac/skandiahack2023ctf/> to start a new workspace.

2. After the Gitpod workspace is loaded, Gitpod tasks is still running to install `npm install`  and launch the website. Despite Gitpod showing your workspace state already as _Running_, you need to wait until the installation process is done, before the website becomes accessable. The _Open Preview Window (Internal Browser)_, will open automatically and refresh itself automatically when the server has started.

3. Your Juice Shop instance is now also available at `https://3000-<GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID>.<GITPOD_HOSTING_ZONE>.gitpod.io`.
